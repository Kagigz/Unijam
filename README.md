## The Story
In order to recover her body, Cara, a lost soul, wanders along a world full of obstacles. She can overcome those obstacles with the help of little souls that follow her everywhere. But once a little soul has offered its services, it disappears until Cara emerges back from the soul vortex.

## The Game
Chromanima is a puzzle-platformer. The player, in order to progress in a level, must use the abilities of the little souls strategically, and reincarnate at the right times. 
- Each ability can overcome 2 obstacles 
- Each obstacle can be defeated with 2 abilities
- When Cara touches purple matter, she reappears at the last "check point" with all the abilities

=> If the player uses the abilities in the wrong order/the wrong way or doesn't "recharge" them when he needs to, he will get stuck and have to start all over again.
